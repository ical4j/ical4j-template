## Introduction

Whilst the icalendar specification may be used to describe just about any activity or event, typically there are some use-cases that are more widely used than others.

Such use-cases may include birthdays and other anniversary-style observances, scheduling activities such as timetables and meetings, task management, and historical activities including recording of meeting minutes.

ical4j-templates offers an opinionated view of how such popular activities may be structured, providing a simpler and consistent approach to time-based management.
